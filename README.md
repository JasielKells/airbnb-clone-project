# Technology Stack

## Core Frameworks
- **Django**: High-level Python web framework for rapid development and clean design of RESTful APIs
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Toolkit for building Web APIs on top of Django, providing serialization, authentication, and viewset functionality
- **GraphQL**: Query language for APIs that enables clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching

## Database & Storage
- **PostgreSQL**: Powerful open-source relational database for structured data storage with advanced features
- **Redis**: In-memory data store used for caching, session management, and Celery task queue
- **Elasticsearch**: Search engine for implementing fast and scalable property search functionality

## Asynchronous Processing
- **Celery**: Distributed task queue system for handling background jobs (emails, payment processing)
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker used as Celery's backend for task queue management

## Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for creating consistent development and production environments
- **Docker Compose**: Tool for defining and running multi-container applications
- **NGINX**: High-performance web server and reverse proxy for load balancing
- **Gunicorn**: Python WSGI HTTP server for serving Django applications

## API Documentation
- **OpenAPI/Swagger**: Standard for documenting RESTful APIs, enabling interactive documentation
- **GraphiQL**: Interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE for exploring the GraphQL API

## Authentication & Security
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Secure token-based authentication system
- **OAuth 2.0**: Authorization framework for third-party application integration
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing library for secure credential storage

## Monitoring & Analytics
- **Prometheus**: Monitoring system for collecting metrics
- **Grafana**: Visualization platform for monitoring data
- **Sentry**: Error tracking and performance monitoring

## CI/CD & Version Control
- **Git**: Distributed version control system
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD platform for automated testing and deployment
- **AWS/GCP**: Cloud platforms for hosting production infrastructure

# Database Design

## 1. Users
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `email` (Unique)
- `password_hash` (Securely encrypted)
- `first_name` & `last_name`
- `user_type` (guest/host/admin)

**Relationships**:
- One-to-Many with Properties (A user can list multiple properties as a host)
- One-to-Many with Bookings (A user can make multiple bookings as a guest)
- One-to-Many with Reviews (A user can write multiple reviews)

## 2. Properties
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `title` (Listing title)
- `description` 
- `price_per_night` (Decimal)
- `host_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `property_type` (apartment/house/villa/etc.)
- `amenities` (Array of available amenities)

**Relationships**:
- Many-to-One with Users (Each property belongs to one host)
- One-to-Many with Bookings (A property can have multiple bookings)
- One-to-Many with Reviews (A property can receive multiple reviews)
- One-to-Many with PropertyImages (A property can have multiple images)

## 3. Bookings
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key to Properties)
- `guest_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `check_in_date` & `check_out_date`
- `total_price` (Calculated from nights Ã— price)
- `status` (confirmed/pending/cancelled)

**Relationships**:
- Many-to-One with Users (Each booking belongs to one guest)
- Many-to-One with Properties (Each booking is for one property)
- One-to-One with Payments (Each booking has one payment record)

## 4. Reviews
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key to Properties)
- `author_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `rating` (1-5 scale)
- `comment` (Text content)
- `created_at` (Timestamp)

**Relationships**:
- Many-to-One with Users (Each review is written by one user)
- Many-to-One with Properties (Each review is for one property)
- (Optional) One-to-One with Bookings (Review can be tied to specific booking)

## 5. Payments
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key to Bookings)
- `amount` (Decimal)
- `payment_method` (credit card/PayPal/etc.)
- `transaction_id` (From payment processor)
- `status` (succeeded/failed/refunded)

**Relationships**:
