# Technology Stack

## Core Frameworks
- **Django**: High-level Python web framework for rapid development and clean design of RESTful APIs
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Toolkit for building Web APIs on top of Django, providing serialization, authentication, and viewset functionality
- **GraphQL**: Query language for APIs that enables clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching

## Database & Storage
- **PostgreSQL**: Powerful open-source relational database for structured data storage with advanced features
- **Redis**: In-memory data store used for caching, session management, and Celery task queue
- **Elasticsearch**: Search engine for implementing fast and scalable property search functionality

## Asynchronous Processing
- **Celery**: Distributed task queue system for handling background jobs (emails, payment processing)
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker used as Celery's backend for task queue management

## Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for creating consistent development and production environments
- **Docker Compose**: Tool for defining and running multi-container applications
- **NGINX**: High-performance web server and reverse proxy for load balancing
- **Gunicorn**: Python WSGI HTTP server for serving Django applications

## API Documentation
- **OpenAPI/Swagger**: Standard for documenting RESTful APIs, enabling interactive documentation
- **GraphiQL**: Interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE for exploring the GraphQL API

## Authentication & Security
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Secure token-based authentication system
- **OAuth 2.0**: Authorization framework for third-party application integration
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing library for secure credential storage

## Monitoring & Analytics
- **Prometheus**: Monitoring system for collecting metrics
- **Grafana**: Visualization platform for monitoring data
- **Sentry**: Error tracking and performance monitoring

## CI/CD & Version Control
- **Git**: Distributed version control system
