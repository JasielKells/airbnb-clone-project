# API Security

## Core Security Measures

### 1. Authentication
**Implementation**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with OAuth 2.0 support  
**Importance**: Ensures only verified users can access protected endpoints. Critical for preventing unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive operations like bookings and payments.

### 2. Authorization
**Implementation**: Role-based access control (RBAC) with permissions  
**Importance**: Restricts actions based on user roles (guest/host/admin). Prevents hosts from modifying others' properties or guests from altering bookings they don't own.

### 3. Rate Limiting
**Implementation**: Redis-backed request throttling  
**Importance**: Protects against brute force attacks and API abuse. Especially crucial for authentication endpoints and payment processing to prevent fraudulent activities.

### 4. Data Encryption
**Implementation**: TLS 1.3 for transit, AES-256 for sensitive data at rest  
**Importance**: Essential for protecting payment details, personal information, and authentication credentials from interception or database breaches.

### 5. Input Validation
**Implementation**: Strict schema validation for all API requests  
**Importance**: Prevents SQL injection and XSS attacks. Critical for all user-generated content like property descriptions and reviews.

## Security-Critical Areas

### User Management
**Protections**: Password hashing (bcrypt), email verification, session management  
**Why**: Compromised user accounts can lead to fraudulent bookings, payment theft, and reputation damage to the platform.

### Payment Processing
**Protections**: PCI-DSS compliance, tokenization, audit logging  
**Why**: Direct financial impact - security breaches can lead to monetary losses and legal consequences.

### Property Management
**Protections**: Ownership verification, image upload scanning  
**Why**: Prevents fraudulent listings and malicious content that could harm users or the platform's reputation.

### Booking System
**Protections**: Conflict validation, anti-sniping mechanisms  
**Why**: Prevents reservation manipulation that could lead to double bookings or financial losses.

### Admin Operations
**Protections**: Multi-factor authentication, IP whitelisting  
**Why**: Admin breaches could compromise the entire platform's data and operations.

## Additional Security Layers
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- Comprehensive activity logging for all sensitive operations
- IP-based anomaly detection for suspicious behavior
